# Lane_Detection_Image_And_Video
This repository contains a two Python-OpenCV files. The file "lane_detetcion_image.py" detected lane in an image, while the file "lane_detection_video.py" detects lanes in a video.

I learned this lesson thanks to tutorial created by collaboration of Rayan Slim and the ProgrammingKnowledge.
